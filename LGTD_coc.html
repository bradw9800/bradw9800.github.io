			<p>The organisers are committed to making this conference productive and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, or religion of the participants. For this reason, harassment of participants in any form will not be tolerated and as part of the registration process, all attendees are required to agree to adhere to the following Code of Conduct.</p>

			
    		<strong>Code of Conduct</strong>
			<p> Attendees are required to behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes and any bullying behaviour are not appropriate. Compliance with these principles and, in particular, with the present Code of Conduct is expected throughout the event and any future interactions that may result from it. Harassment includes sustained disruption of talks or other events, sustained unwanted contact, sexual attention or innuendo, deliberate intimidation, pressuring, stalking, and photography or recording of an individual without consent. It also includes offensive or belittling comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, or religion.
			</p>
		<strong>Incident reporting and resolution</strong>
			<p> If you observe someone making you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please tell them so, and remind them of the Code of Conduct. Non-confrontational alternatives can be to create a distraction or to refer the person to an organiser. If you witness or experience harassment, please notify one of the organisers immediately, so they can take appropriate action. Harassment, bullying and hate speech should be reported to <a href="https://report-support.ucl.ac.uk/">UCL Report + Support</a>, and hate crimes should be reported to the <a href="https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-and-support/support/hate-crime-reporting">UCL Hate Crime Reporting Centre</a>.
			</p>
		<strong>Sanctions</strong>
			<p> When someone is asked to stop any behaviour that violates the Code of Conduct, they are expected to comply immediately. In response to behaviour deemed inappropriate by the organising committee (e.g. rudeness, unprofessional behaviour), the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. Attendees who display any behaviour considered harassment will be asked to leave the event immediately or will be removed from the event by the organisers.
		
		<p> Other specific actions may include but are not limited to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Asking the person to cease the inappropriate behaviour, and warning them that any further reports will result in other sanctions. They might be required to make conciliatory efforts that may include an apology, informal mediation, or other steps intended to facilitate restoration of relationships.</li>
				<li>Early termination of a talk that violates the Code of Conduct.</li>
				<li>Immediately ending any event responsibilities or privileges held.</li>
				<li>Requiring that the person immediately leave the event and not return.</li>
				<li>Reporting the incident to competent authorities.</li>
			</ul>
